629. Minimum Spanning Tree 最小生成树

给出一些Connections，即Connections类，找到一些能够将所有城市都连接起来并且花费最小的边。
如果说可以将所有城市都连接起来，则返回这个连接方法；不然的话返回一个空列表。
Given a list of Connections, which is the Connection class (the city name at both ends of the edge and a cost between them), 
find edges that can connect all the cities and spend the least amount.
Return the connects if can connect all the cities, otherwise return empty list.

样例
样例 1:

输入:
["Acity","Bcity",1]
["Acity","Ccity",2]
["Bcity","Ccity",3]
输出:
["Acity","Bcity",1]
["Acity","Ccity",2]
样例 2:

输入:
["Acity","Bcity",2]
["Bcity","Dcity",5]
["Acity","Dcity",4]
["Ccity","Ecity",1]
输出:
[]

解释:
没有办法连通

注意事项
返回按cost排序的连接方法，如果cost相同就按照city1进行排序，如果city1也相同那么就按照city2进行排序。
Return the connections sorted by the cost, or sorted city1 name if their cost is same, 
or sorted city2 if their city1 name is also same.
